Can you validate the results of the paper? Can you build a better model?
- http://uksim.info/uksim2015/data/8713a015.pdf


First, read the paper. Then, download the data here:- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+Comment+Volume+Dataset

Can you train and MLP that beats a tuned RF?

Considerations:

- Remember all the steps required to complete a ML project

- Where possible include data/ML pipelines and code modularity

- Choose an evaluation metric

- Place utility functions and other code in a file that you can import. See discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36427747/scientific-computing-ipython-notebook-how-to-organize-code and https://www.slideshare.net/katenerush/clean-code-in-jupyter-notebooks?next_slideshow=1

- For the MLP part use TensorFlow

- Deadline for submissions no later than Dec. 16th, 2017 by 8am.



Comments: 
- Start with one of the data variations, then build on top of that- Submit all your final notebooks and external code- This is an individual project not a group project.
